dotfiles
======

Setup
------

Download the latest setup script with `curl` and peruse the file for anything
disagreeable.

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boombador/dotfiles/master/setup.sh -O
```

Run the script to install the dotfiles in this repository. 

```
bash setup.sh
```

Note: The script assumes you want to download most of your code repositories:
in a directory called `$HOME/Code`. You currently have to edit the `setup.sh`
and `bash.sh` manually.
